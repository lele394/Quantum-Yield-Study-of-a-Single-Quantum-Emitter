# M2 CompuPhys Quantum Yield Study of a Single Quantum Emitter

This repo contains the code and report for the study of a single quantum emitter in air, next to a gold bar, next to one gold nano-antenna, and next to two gold nano-antenna. We study the evolution of the quantum yield of the systems.

Simulations have been done using FDTD software R-Soft.

Data is not present in the repo due to the size.
